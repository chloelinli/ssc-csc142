Compilation of South Seattle College CSC 142 assignments

#### FixedCalculator.java
- [ ] Need to edit print statements
- [x] Annoying typo in *caluculateResults* method header, but too lazy to go through entire program
- Very simple program
- No known bugs
- Some needed edits to print statements
- Required to add new implementation
  - Added two new operations (square root `sqrt`, absolute value `abs`) as **Type**
    - Format uses Strings, so had to separate
  - Added conditions (greater than `>`, less than `<`, etc) as **Operation**
    - Format works like given operations
#### SmileyFace.java
- Bugs? Not sure
- Ugliest thing ever
- No seriously, don't run it
> Professor: I really like this animation! It is very cute and the animation is quite smooth (which is not easy when using the DrawingPanel class)
#### GuessMePractice.java
- Advanced bugs that require too many loops and edge cases
#### Chatbot.java
- Somehow got full points even with bugs
- Are there bugs? I'm pretty sure there are
- I like puns
