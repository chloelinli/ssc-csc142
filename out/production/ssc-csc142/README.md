## SSC CSC 142
Compilation of CSC 142 assignments

Slowly figuring out bugs, I'm a student D: please bear with me, these projects are bad enough
#### FixedCalculator.java
- [ ] Need to edit print statements
- [x] Annoying typo in *caluculateResults* method header, but too lazy to go through entire program
- Very simple program
- No known bugs
- Some needed edits to print statements
- Required to add new implementation
  - Added two new operations (square root `sqrt`, absolute value `abs`) as **Type**
    - Format uses Strings, so had to separate
  - Added conditions (greater than `>`, less than `<`, etc) as **Operation**
    - Format works like given operations
#### SmileyFace.java
- Bugs? Not sure
- Ugliest thing ever
- No seriously, don't run it
> Professor: I really like this animation! It is very cute and the animation is quite smooth (which is not easy when using the DrawingPanel class)
#### GuessMePractice.java
- Bugs? Oh yes, but not sure how to fix yet
> Professor: Your hints are too confusing, so I found your game frustrating. 9 was "too far" and 10 was "not quite there yet" -- well there is nothing in between that would be "just right"!
#### Chatbot.java
- Somehow got full points even with bugs
- Are there bugs? I'm pretty sure there are
- I like puns
